Installation
------------

Once you have installed SimpleSAMLphp, installing this module is very simple. Just execute the following
command in the root of your SimpleSAMLphp installation:

```
composer.phar require simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp-module-logpeek:dev-master
```

where `dev-master` instructs Composer to install the `master` branch from the Git repository. See the
[releases](https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp-module-logpeek/releases) available if you
want to use a stable version of the module.

The module is enabled by default. If you want to disable the module once installed, you just need to create a file named
`disable` in the `modules/logpeek/` directory inside your SimpleSAMLphp installation.
