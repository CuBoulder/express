Feature: Basic Page Content Type
When I login to a Web Express website
As an authenticated user
I should be able to create, edit, and delete Basic Pages

# NOTE: THERE IS CURRENTLY NO KNOWN WAY TO PRESS THE INSERT BUTTON; GRAPHICS CAN BE UPLOADED BUT NOT INSERTED
# CONTINUE TESTING THIS PROBLEM WITH PHOTOINSERT.FEATURE

# 1) CHECK NODE ADD PRIVILEDGES
# 2) CHECK THAT SIMPLE NODE CAN BE CREATED AND REVISED
# 3) CHECK EDITING AND DELETING PRIVILEGES ON THE CONTENT JUST MADE
# 4) CHECK THAT DELETE BUTTON ACTUALLY WORKS
# 5) CHECK MORE COMPLEX NODE CREATION

# 1) CHECK NODE ADD PRIVILEGES 
Scenario Outline: Node Access - Some roles can add Basic Page content
Given I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
When I go to "node/add/page"
Then I should see <message>

Examples:
 | role                 | message             |
 | developer            | "Create Basic page" |
| administrator         | "Create Basic page" |
| site_owner            | "Create Basic page" |
| content_editor        | "Create Basic page" |
| edit_my_content       | "Access Denied"     |
| site_editor           | "Create Basic page" |
| edit_only             | "Access Denied"     |
| access_manager        | "Access Denied"     |
| configuration_manager | "Access Denied"     |

Scenario: Node Access -  An anonymous user cannot add Basic Page content
 When I am on "node/add/page"
 Then I should see "Access denied"
  
#  2) CHECK THAT SIMPLE NODE CAN BE CREATED
 Scenario: Node Functionality - A very basic Basic Page node can be created 
 Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
  And I am on "node/add/page"
  And fill in "edit-title" with "My Page"
  And fill in "Body" with "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
  When I press "edit-submit"
 Then I should be on "/my-page"
 And I should see "My Page"
And I should see "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
 
 # 2.5 CREATE REVISIONS TO THE NODE ABOVE
Scenario: Node functionality - Create Revision and Change Authorship of node
Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
And I am on "admin/content"
And I follow "My Page"
And I follow "Edit"
 # BROKEN AT THIS TIME And fill in "edit-name" with "osr-test-edit-own" 
 And fill in "Body" with "Lavender Lemon Drops"
 And I press "Save"
 Then I should see "Basic page My Page has been updated."

# 3) CHECK EDITING AND DELETING PRIVILEGES ON THE CONTENT JUST MADE

Scenario Outline: Node Access -  Some roles can edit and delete Basic Page content
Given I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
And I am on "admin/content"
And I follow "My Page"
Then I should see "View"
And I should see "Edit"
And I should see "Edit Layout"
And I should see "Revisions"
And I should see "Clear Page Cache"
When I follow "Edit"
Then I should see "This document is now locked against simultaneous editing."
And I should see an "#edit-delete" element
And I press "Cancel edit"

Examples: 
| role |
| developer       | 
| administrator   | 
| site_owner      | 
| content_editor  |
| site_editor |

Scenario: Node Access -  Edit Only can edit but not delete node; can clear page cache
Given I am logged in as a user with the "edit_only" role
And I am on "admin/content"
And I follow "My Page"
Then I should see "View"
And I should see "Edit"
And I should not see "Edit Layout"
And I should not see "Revisions"
And I should see "Clear Page Cache"
When I follow "Edit"
Then I should see "This document is now locked against simultaneous editing."
And I should not see an "#edit-delete" element
And I press "Cancel edit"

@broken @rolefix
#THIS TEST IS BROKEN UNTIL AUTHORSHIP CAN BE ASSIGNED ABOVE
Scenario: Node Access -  Edit My Content can edit but not delete node; can clear page cache
Given I am logged in as a user with the "edit_my_content" role
And I am on "admin/content"
And I follow "My Page"
Then I should see "View"
And I should see "Edit"
And I should not see "Edit Layout"
And I should not see "Revisions"
And I should not see "Clear Page Cache"
When I follow "Edit"
Then I should see "This document is now locked against simultaneous editing."
And I should not see an "#edit-delete" element
And I press "Cancel edit"


Scenario Outline: Node Access -  The add on roles cannot by themselves access Basic Page content
Given I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
And I am on "admin/content"
Then I should see "Access denied"

Examples:
| role                 | 
| access_manager        | 
| configuration_manager | 


# 4) CHECK THAT DELETE BUTTON ACTUALLY WORKS

Scenario: Verify that the Delete button actually works
 Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
And I am on "admin/content"
And I follow "My Page"
And I follow "Edit"
 And I press "Delete"
 Then I should see "Are you sure you want to delete My Page?"
 And I press "Delete"
 Then I should see "Basic page My Page has been deleted."
 And I am on "/"


# 5) CHECK MORE COMPLEX NODE CREATION

@api
Scenario: A graphic can be uploaded to a Basic Page node
  Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
  And I am on "node/add/page"
  And fill in "edit-title" with "About Ralphie"
  And fill in "Body" with "Ralphie the Buffalo is the name of the live mascot of the University of Colorado Buffaloes."
 And I fill in "edit-field-photo-und-0-alt" with "Ralphie Buffalo with handlers"
 And I attach the file "ralphie.jpg" to "edit-field-photo-und-0-upload"
And I press "edit-field-photo-und-0-upload-button"
 Then I should see "File information"
 And I should see "ralphie.jpg"
 And I should see "Insert"
 And I press "edit-submit"
 Then I should be on "/about-ralphie"
And I should see "About Ralphie"
And I should see "Ralphie the Buffalo is the name of the live mascot of the University of Colorado Buffaloes."
 
@api 
Scenario: The provide menu link box should be checked on node creation but remain unchecked if user chooses to uncheck that box.
Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
When I go to "node/add/page"
And I fill in "edit-title" with "Not In Menu"
Then the "edit-menu-enabled" checkbox should be checked
When I uncheck "edit-menu-enabled"
And I press "Save"
# ADD CHECK FOR PAGE TITLE
Then I should see "Not In Menu"
And I follow "Edit"
Then the checkbox "edit-menu-enabled" should be unchecked
