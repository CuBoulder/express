@structure @javascript
Feature: Context
In order to exercise control over my regions, pages and blocks 
As an authenticated user
I should be able to set conditions and reactions with Context


Scenario Outline: An authenticated user should be able to access the form for adding a Context
    Given I am logged in as a user with the <role> role
    When I go to "admin/structure/context"
    Then I should see <message>

    Examples:
    | role            | message |
    | edit_my_content | "Access denied" |
    | content_editor  | "Context allows you to manage contextual conditions" |
    | site_owner      | "Context allows you to manage contextual conditions" |
    | administrator   | "Context allows you to manage contextual conditions" |
    | developer       | "Context allows you to manage contextual conditions" |
    | configuration_manager | "Access denied" |
    | site_editor | "Context allows you to manage contextual conditions" |
    | edit_only | "Access denied" |
    | access_manager | "Access denied" |
    | form_manager | "Access denied" |
