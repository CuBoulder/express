# CONTEXT FUNCTIONALITY IS TESTED IN OTHER FEATURES. 
# THIS FEATURE TARGETS SITE BACKGROUND IMAGES AND PAGE TITLE IMAGES ONLY


# THIS SCENARIO UPLOADS A GRAPHIC TO USE AS BACKGROUND
# NEED A CUSTOM STEP TO FIGURE OUT THE NODE ID
Scenario: A background image can be uploaded for use in tests
 Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
 Then I go to "node/add/file"
 And I fill in "edit-title" with "Background Graphic"
 And I attach the file "cupcakes.jpg" to "edit-field-file-attachment-und-0-upload"
 And I press "Upload"
 # THIS NEXT LINE VERIFIES THAT THE UPLOAD WAS SUCCESSFUL
 Then I should see "File Information"
 And I should see "Operations"
 And I press "edit-submit"
 Then I should see "File Background Graphic has been created."
# And I find out the node ID and save it in a variable

Scenario: An authenticated user can attach a background image to a site
 Given I am logged in as a user with the "site_owner" role
 # THEME MUST SUPPORT BACKGROUND GRAPHIC; I.E. LAYOUT == BOXED; THIS LINK ACTIVATES SHADOW THEME
 And I go to "admin/theme/active/cushadow"
 And I go to "/"
 Then the response should contain "cushadow/favicon.ico"
 # NEXT GO TO CONTEXT AND ADD THE GRAPHIC TO BACKSTRETCH
 Then I go to "admin/structure/context/list/sitewide/edit"
 And I select "backstretch" from "edit-reactions-selector"
 # USE THE NODE ID IN THIS NEXT STEP
 # And I fill in "edit-reactions-plugins-backstretch-backstretch-url" with "node/XXX/backstretch"
 And I press "Save"
 # THEN GO TO HOMEPAGE; FINAL CHECK IS THAT 'BACKSTRETCH' and 'NODE ID' IS FOUND IN THE PAGE RESPONSE
 And I go to "/"
 Then the response should contain "backstretchURL"
 # WHEN WE KNOW NODE URL: And the response should contain "node\/XXX\/backstretch"
    
@javascript
Scenario: An authenticated user can attach a background image to a page title
