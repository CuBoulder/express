# Github Specific Process

Our process depends heavily on [labels defined in Github](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels).

## Use of Epics

While script agile defines Epics as...

Only Epics require needs: labels.

Only Epics should be added to a sprint.

## Use of type:Task or type:Bug

An Epic can stand alone and be type:Task or have several tasks associated to it.  Commits should only be made to branches for type:Task or type:Bug.  

Epics, Tasks and Bugs all use different issue templates.

## needs:

Before an Epic is assigned to a sprint and any work is done, the [needs:Director Approval](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels/needs%3ADirector%20Approval) and [needs:More Information](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels/needs%3AMore%20Information) labels must removed.  Once those are removed, staff with responsibility for specific areas of the Web Express service should review the Epic and either request more information and document any concerns.  If no additional information is needed and there are no concerns, remove that label.
