# Github Specific Process

Our process depends heavily on [labels defined in Github](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels).

## Epics

We use the ZenHub approach to Epics. “A theme of work that contain sub-tasks required to complete the larger goal. The concept stems from the agile principle that tasks should be broken down into small, manageable chunks; that way, you're able to ship impactful changes more often and ultimately gain more control over the release cycle. In agile development, a ‘user story’ is the smallest unit of work, and an Epic is essentially a ‘big’ user story.”

Epics are the only issue type that require `evaluate` labels.

## General Feature Request Flow

1. Create a [new Issue](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/issues/new) following the template.
    * Apply the following labels: `Epic`, `evaluate-1:Director Approval` and all `evaluate-2` labels.
1. Epic is reviewed by the **Director**.
    * If it is approved, the Director will remove the `evaluate-1:Director Approval` label.
1. Epic is reviewed by relevant team member.
    * As reviews are done, team members will either leave a comment and apply the `evaluate-1:More Information` label or remove the relevent `evaluate-2` label.
1. Once all `evaluate` labels are removed, an Epic can be considered for inclusion in an upcoming Sprint.
1. Issue is added to a Sprint (not neccisarily the _next_ sprint) and assigned to a **Developer**.
    * When a Sprint is created, a QA Epic will also be created.
1. **Developer** scopes out the work and creates additional Issues of `type:task` as needed.
    * Issues of `type:task` may be added to the current sprint.
1. Issues of `type:task` are assigned to a **Developer** who writes code.
    * If Developers want to commit code to branches for each Issue of `type:task`, use a branch named after the Epic as an integration branch.
1. If someone wants to preview code for any of the following reasons, apply the label `qa:Needs Instance` to the Epic and assign additional users as applicable.
    * Concept acceptance (does this meet the Director's expectations). Assign **Director**.
    * Documenation creation or update. Assign **Support Lead**.
    * Feedback from non-technical users. Assign **additional users**.
1. A **QA Engineer** will create an instance with the relevant code. They will remove the label `qa:Needs Instance` and apply the label `qa:Instance Ready`.
1. Relevent users will review the instance and provide feedback in the Epic. When a user has completed their work on the Instance, they will remove themself from the list of assignees.
1. When an Epic has no assignees, the **Developer** will create a Pull Request against the `dev` branch of Express.
    * If the Epic needs QA during the release window (ex. Epic: Update Contrib as of May 1, 2017), create Issues of `type:qa` in the QA Epic for the Sprint (ex. updated Context do create 'Issue: Test Advanced Layout' and 'Issue: Test Advanced Design').
1. A **Developer** who was not involved in writing the code will review the code using the GitHub PR review tools.
1. When all PR feedback is addressed, a **Developer** who was not involved in writing the code will merge the PR.
1. The Feature will be deployed as part of the next release.

## Use of Type labels

`type:Task`, `type:Bug`, `type:QA`

* An Epic can stand alone as a `type:Task` and a single branch and Pull Request (PR) or have several tasks associated to it with their own branches and PRs.
* Code should only be committed to branches for `type:Task` or `type:Bug`.
* Epics, Tasks and Bugs all use different templates.
* `type:QA` gives information about how a code change may impact current functioanlity to aid in testing during the Release window.

## Use of Improvement Labels

These tags are mainly for reporting the number of tasks that contributed to an improvements vs. bugs. If you are unsure of which type of improvemnt, use the general improvement tags.
