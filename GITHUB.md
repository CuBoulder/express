# Github Specific Process

Our process depends heavily on [labels defined in Github](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels).

## Use of Epics

Strict Agile Scrum Methodology defines an Epic as "work, which can not be completed in a week time, or any work which will take a full sprint to complete".

We prefer the ZenHub approach to Epics.  “A theme of work that contain sub-tasks required to complete the larger goal. The concept stems from the agile principle that tasks should be broken down into small, manageable chunks; that way, you're able to ship impactful changes more often and ultimately gain more control over the release cycle. In agile development, a ‘user story’ is the smallest unit of work, and an Epic is essentially a ‘big’ user story.”

Epics are the only issue type that require evaluate: labels. 

Only Epics and Bugs will be added to a sprint.

## Use of type:Task or type:Bug

An Epic can stand alone as a type:Task and a single branch and Pull Request (PR) or have several tasks associated to it with their own branches and PRs.  Code should only be committed to branches for type:Task or type:Bug.  

Epics, Tasks and Bugs all use different issue templates.

## evaluate:

Before an Epic is assigned to a sprint and any work is done, the [evaluate-1:Director Approval](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels/evaluate-1%3ADirector%20Approval) and [evaluate-1:More Information](https://github.com/CuBoulder/express/labels/evaluate-1%3AMore%20Information) labels must removed.  Once those are removed, staff with responsibility for specific areas of the Web Express service should review the Epic requesting more information or documenting any concerns.  If no additional information is needed and there are no concerns, remove that evaluate: label.

The hope is that evaluations can be done at any time so Epics are ready for a developer to start working on as soon as they are added to a sprint.

## improvements:

These tags are mainly for reporting the number of tasks that contributed to an improvements vs. bugs.  If you are unsure of which type of improvemnt, use the general improvement tags.
